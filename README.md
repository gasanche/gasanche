Hello, World! 👋 I'm Gabriela Camila Sanchez, and I'm on a quest to conquer the digital universe, one line of code at a time! 🚀 I'm a passionate programmer with a love for turning complex problems into elegant solutions (and sometimes, into hilarious bugs 🐛). Currently fluent in C, C++, and Python (check out my custom Python course, coming soon to a GitHub near you! 😉), I'm finishing up my Bachelor's in Business Administration and a Master's in Strategic Business Analytics at EAE Business School. My ultimate goal? To wield the mighty power of Data Science and uncover hidden insights! 📊
When I'm not wrestling with algorithms, you can probably find me dominating the Rift in League of Legends (Yuumi main... Yup you might find it disgusting), tinkering with the latest tech gadgets, or, more likely, being completely mesmerized by my adorable cat, Momo. 😻 Seriously, cats are just the best.
